Subject: Opposition to New Visa Policies Targeting Chinese Students

Dear Secretary Rubio and Secretary Noem,

As a proud naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in China and came to the United States as an international student, I write to express my deep opposition to the U.S. Department of State’s recently announced visa policies, dated May 28, 2025, which call for the aggressive revocation of visas for Chinese students, particularly those studying in critical fields like STEM and artificial intelligence (AI) or with perceived connections to the Chinese Communist Party, as well as enhanced scrutiny of visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong. Ref:[https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/new-visa-policies-put-america-first-not-china/](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/new-visa-policies-put-america-first-not-china/)

These measures are not only discriminatory and contrary to American values but also undermine the United States’ ability to attract global talent, a cornerstone of its economic and technological leadership. Moreover, as a fellow immigrant from a country with a complex political history, I urge you, Secretary Rubio, to reflect on how such policies, if applied to Cuban students in the past, might have prevented your own family’s contributions to this nation.

Secretary Rubio, your parents came to the United States from Cuba in 1956, seeking a better life during the Batista regime, before Fidel Castro’s rise to power. Your family’s journey, like mine, embodies the American Dream—a dream made possible by America’s openness to immigrants. Had policies similar to those now targeting Chinese students been in place, scrutinizing Cuban immigrants for vague “connections” to their government or restricting their ability to study in critical fields, your family might have faced insurmountable barriers to entering or remaining in the United States. Your grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, faced deportation proceedings in 1962 but was granted parolee status, allowing him to stay and contribute to this country. This opportunity shaped your path to becoming the first Cuban-American Secretary of State. The irony is stark: a policy that could have excluded you now threatens to exclude countless Chinese students who, like your family, seek only to pursue education and opportunity in a free society.

The United States has long been a beacon for the world’s brightest minds, fostering innovation through its openness to talent from all nations. As a former Chinese student who pursued advanced studies in computer science and high-performance computing(HPC), I know firsthand the transformative power of this openness. Yet, the proposed policies risk undermining this legacy by unfairly targeting Chinese students based on their nationality rather than their individual merits. This approach violates the American principle of treating people as individuals, as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Blanket restrictions on Chinese students, particularly those in fields like HPC and AI, assume guilt by association and disregard their personal aspirations and contributions. Such policies are not only discriminatory but also contrary to the principles of due process and equal protection under the law.

Moreover, these policies will drive top talent away from the United States and into the arms of competitors, including the Chinese government. By restricting access to U.S. education, we risk alienating brilliant minds who could otherwise contribute to America’s technological leadership. History shows that international students, including those from China, have been integral to U.S. innovation. Many leading AI researchers and tech entrepreneurs in the United States are immigrants or former international students who chose to stay and build their careers here. If we close our doors to these individuals, we weaken our innovation ecosystem and empower rival nations to capitalize on the talent we reject.

The policy’s focus on “connections to the Chinese Communist Party” is overly vague and risks casting a wide net that ensnares innocent students. Many Chinese students, particularly from mainland China, may have nominal or involuntary affiliations with state institutions due to the structure of China’s education system. These affiliations often bear no relation to their personal beliefs or actions. Subjecting these students to heightened scrutiny or visa revocation without clear evidence of wrongdoing is unjust and will create a chilling effect, discouraging even the most talented and well-intentioned students from pursuing opportunities in the United States.

America’s global leadership in science and technology depends on its ability to attract and retain talent from all corners of the world. By imposing restrictive visa policies, we undermine our competitive edge at a time when global innovation is accelerating. Countries like Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom have implemented policies to attract international students and researchers, recognizing their value to economic growth and innovation. If the United States continues down this path of exclusion, we risk ceding our position as the world’s preeminent destination for talent and ideas.

Secretary Rubio, your own story as the son of Cuban immigrants underscores the value of giving individuals a chance to contribute to America’s success. Your rise to one of the highest offices in the land is a testament to the opportunities this country affords to those who come here with ambition and determination. I urge you to consider how the policies you now champion could have altered your own trajectory had they been applied to Cuban immigrants decades ago. I respectfully request that the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security reconsider these policies and adopt a balanced approach that prioritizes national security without sacrificing America’s core values or long-term interests. Robust vetting processes already exist to address legitimate security concerns, and these can be strengthened without resorting to broad, discriminatory measures.

I call on you to engage with stakeholders, including immigrant communities, academic institutions, and industry leaders, to craft policies that uphold fairness, promote innovation, and strengthen America’s global leadership. As a naturalized citizen who has benefited from America’s openness and contributed to its society, I am deeply saddened by the direction of these policies. Let us preserve the inclusive spirit that allowed both you and me to call this nation home.

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. I hope you will reflect on the parallels between your family’s journey and the aspirations of today’s Chinese students, ensuring that America remains a land of opportunity for all who seek to contribute to its greatness.

Sincerely,

Chunhua Liao, Ph.D.
