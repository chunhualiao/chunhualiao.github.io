I don’t go to the doctor often. But when I do, I expect to be able to see one without waiting nearly a month.

Unfortunately, that’s not the case with **Kaiser Permanente in Northern California**, where I get my healthcare coverage through my employer. Despite paying **$2,770 every month** for health insurance covering a family of four members — yes, you read that right — I routinely wait **3 to 4 weeks** to see even a primary care physician now in east bayarea. Before COVID, I could usually see my physician within a few days.

So what exactly am I — and millions of others — paying for?

## **🔍 The Numbers: How Bad Is It Really?**

Let’s break it down.

* **Monthly Premium**:
    
    To cover a family of four members, I pay **$224 every two weeks** directly out of my paycheck.
    
    My employer contributes another **$1,054.23** every two weeks.
    
    → That’s **$2,770/month** in total for my family of four.
    
* **What It Buys Me**:
    
    * Wait times of **3–4 weeks** for most non-urgent visits
        
    * Co-pays of **$25–$35** per visit
        
    * Very limited access to outside specialists or second opinions
        
    * Often rushed appointments with overworked doctors

## **🧯 This Isn’t Just Me — It’s a Systemic Problem**

This isn’t a personal grudge. It’s a widespread failure of a high-cost, low-access system:

* The **average family premium in the U.S.** was **$2,131/month in 2024 (grew by 7%)**. My Kaiser plan’s **$2,770** is **30% higher** than the national average【source: [KFF Employer Health Benefits Survey](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/kff-employer-family-premiums-rose-7-2024)】.
    
* **Average wait times for a primary care appointment** in major U.S. cities?
    
    **20.6 days** — and climbing. Across five specialities, there is a **26.0-day** average wait time【source: [Merritt Hawkins Survey](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/clinical-care/physician-appointment-wait-times-have-increased-significantly-survey-finds)】.
    
* **Doctor burnout is surging**, with nearly **53% of physicians** reporting burnout in 2023【source: [Medscape National Physician Burnout Report](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medscape-physician-burnout-and-depression-report-burnout-worsening-depression-increasing-301732504.html)】 — driving shorter appointments, rushed care, and rising turnover.

## **🧠 Why Is This Happening?**

Several **root causes** are behind this contradiction between high cost and low service:

1. **Administrative Cost Bloat**:
    
    A huge chunk of healthcare spending goes to administrative overhead. Administrative spending is estimated at 15–30% of total U.S. healthcare spending, with at least half deemed “ineffective” (not contributing to health outcomes). U.S. healthcare administrative costs are **4x higher** than other developed countries like Canada or the UK【source: [Health Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/briefs/role-administrative-waste-excess-us-health-spending)】.
    
2. **Provider Shortages**:
    
    The U.S. faces a growing shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs), projected to reach 17,800–48,000 by 2034 (Association of American Medical Colleges, 2020). Northern California has a **primary care desert**, even in affluent suburbs like mine (east bay area). The Permanente Medical Group (TPMG)'s 9,000+ physicians in Northern California (as of 2024) serve 4.5 million members, but the ratio ( ~1 PCP per 2,000 members) strains capacity during demand spikes.
    
3. **Population Growth and Aging**:
    
    Northern California’s population (e.g., Bay Area, Sacramento) has grown, and the aging population requires more frequent primary care for chronic diseases. Kaiser’s 4.5 million members in Northern California include a significant proportion of older adults, increasing demand.

## **🧩 Why the Free Market Hasn’t Fixed Healthcare (Yet)**

In theory, the free market solves inefficiencies through competition, innovation, and consumer choice. But U.S. healthcare is *not* a functioning free market — it’s a heavily distorted quasi-market where normal rules of supply and demand are suspended.

Here are the **core distortions** through a free-market lens:

### **❌ 1. No Price Discovery**

In a functioning market, consumers know prices and can compare value. In U.S. healthcare:

* Prices are hidden or meaningless (often vary by 10× between hospitals for the same service).
    
* Insured patients rarely know what they owe until *after* treatment.
    
* Providers, payers, and middlemen (like pharmacy benefit managers) obscure pricing through complex billing codes and negotiated rates.
    

🧠 **Market theory insight**: Without transparent prices, **competition cannot function**.

### **❌ 2. Consumer Cannot Act as Rational Agent**

* Most patients don’t choose their insurance — their **employer does**.
    
* Even if you wanted to switch, **networks restrict your provider choices**, and switching plans means navigating a maze of red tape.
    
* Medical emergencies make it impossible to “shop around.”
    

🧠 **Market theory insight**: Without real consumer agency, **demand signals are weak or misaligned**.

### **❌ 3. Entry Barriers Prevent New Supply**

* New hospitals or clinics often require government approval via **Certificate of Need (CON)** laws — anti-competitive relics that **protect incumbents**.
    
* State-by-state **medical licensing** restricts skilled providers (like nurse practitioners) from practicing to their full training.
    
* Medical residency slots are capped by federal funding, **artificially limiting physician supply** despite demand.
    

🧠 **Market theory insight**: Supply is artificially constrained — **entry barriers destroy competition**.

### **❌ 4. Third-Party Payer Problem**

* When someone else (insurer or government) pays for your care, **you lose the incentive to shop for value**.
    
* Providers cater to insurers — not patients — and billing is optimized for insurance reimbursement, not efficiency or outcome.
    

🧠 **Market theory insight**: Third-party payment introduces **moral hazard** and **eliminates price discipline**.

### **❌ 5. Consolidation and Monopoly Power**

* Hospital mergers, insurer mergers, and vertically integrated systems (like Kaiser) **reduce competition** and raise prices.
    
* In many cities, 1–2 hospital systems dominate the market and can set prices without fear of losing patients.
    

🧠 **Market theory insight**: Monopoly or oligopoly conditions **neutralize competitive pressure**.

## **🛠️ A Free Market Roadmap to Fix Healthcare**

To fix healthcare, we must **restore market conditions**: price transparency, consumer choice, low entry barriers, and aligned incentives. Here’s what that looks like:

### **✅ 1. Price Transparency**

* Require all hospitals, clinics, and insurers to **publish standardized, bundled prices** for procedures.
    
* Enforce existing transparency laws (many are ignored today).
    
* Let patients **compare cost and quality like they would for airlines or hotels**.
    

🎯 **Outcome**: Informed consumers = real competition = lower prices, better value.

### **✅ 2. Portable, Individual-Controlled Insurance**

* Decouple insurance from employment.
    
* Promote **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)** and **individual market plans** that people can shop for on open exchanges.
    
* Support **catastrophic-only insurance** models paired with cash-pay for routine care.
    

🎯 **Outcome**: Insurance becomes a **consumer product**, not a job perk.

### **✅ 3. Unleash Provider Supply**

* Eliminate **CON laws** that block new clinics or imaging centers.
    
* Expand medical residency funding and allow **more foreign-trained doctors** to practice with proper vetting.
    
* Allow **nurse practitioners and physician assistants** to practice independently in more states.
    

🎯 **Outcome**: More supply → lower prices, shorter wait times.

### **✅ 4. Enable Interstate Competition**

* Allow insurance and telehealth providers to operate **across state lines**.
    
* Let practitioners serve patients nationwide, especially through **virtual care platforms**.
    

🎯 **Outcome**: Larger market = more competition = innovation and better access.

### **✅ 5. Promote Cash-Pay, Transparent Clinics**

* Encourage **Direct Primary Care (DPC)** and **surgical centers of excellence** that operate on cash or fixed-fee models.
    
* Exempt low-cost, transparent care models from the most burdensome regulations.
    

🎯 **Outcome**: Competing models force legacy systems to improve.

### **✅ 6. Align Payment with Outcomes**

* Move away from “fee-for-service” billing to **value-based care**, where providers are rewarded for improving health, not for doing more procedures.
    
* Leverage **AI to guide evidence-based care** and reduce unnecessary spending.
    

🎯 **Outcome**: Incentives drive real results, not volume.

## **🚨 This Is a Wake-Up Call**

We are reaching a breaking point: middle-class professionals are paying thousands per month and still can’t see a doctor in a reasonable time frame. This isn’t sustainable, and it isn’t fair.

## **📣 Join the Fight for Smarter Healthcare**

I’m writing this not just to vent, but to **call on engineers, doctors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers** to take this seriously.

America’s healthcare system is bloated, inefficient, and opaque — and even highly paid professionals are getting ripped off.

Let’s build **tech-empowered, patient-centered models** that make health access as fast, transparent, and intelligent as modern tech industry or online shopping.

If we don’t fix this — who will?
