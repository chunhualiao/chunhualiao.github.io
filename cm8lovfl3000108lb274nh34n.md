Recently, there has been a discussion on how to overcome the middle-income trap. Economic development is driven by three main factors: increasing labor (labor-intensive), increasing investment (capital-intensive), and vigorously developing technological innovation (innovation-driven). Labor and capital inputs can help economies escape poverty and enter the ranks of middle-income countries. However, labor and capital-intensive economies have their limits. To achieve sustainable development and transition to and maintain a developed country status, economies ultimately need to rely on a large amount of innovation that significantly improves production efficiency. This highlights the core role of innovation in economic development.

The United States, especially Silicon Valley, despite having various issues, is still considered a top innovator globally. There is an abundance of research on how Silicon Valley in the U.S. fosters innovation. Common explanations include the presence of world-class universities (Stanford University, UC Berkeley), a relaxed business environment (no non-compete clauses), a diverse pool of innovative talents from around the world, and pervasive venture capital funding. These factors all make sense. However, I have increasingly come to realize that the most fundamental driving force for innovation, which has not received enough attention in the Chinese community, is the mindset of equality for all.

**1\. The Mindset of Equality Generates Healthy Confidence in the Most People**

Innovation is a high-risk endeavor that involves doing what no one has done before. It requires individuals with strong psychological fortitude and an enigmatic level of confidence. The mindset of equality can produce the healthiest form of confidence. People with this mindset can look at various innovative talents on an equal footing: regardless of when or where these talents emerged, they are essentially the same as me. If they can think and do it, and if I have similar aspirations, efforts, and opportunities, I can achieve it too.

Some of the most prominent innovative entrepreneurs globally today, such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman, come from ordinary backgrounds without dazzling family histories or prominent statuses. They dare to think and pursue the most audacious directions in innovation: sending humans to Mars or developing general artificial intelligence. The core reason is that deep down, they view other innovative talents equally. By looking at everyone, including geniuses, on an equal basis, they naturally possess a healthy confidence. They can start working on the directions they believe in without waiting for approval or recognition from other experts. Even if experts oppose them, they continue confidently with what they have identified as the right path.

**2\. The Mindset of Equality Helps the Most People Trying to Innovate Get Support**

Innovation requires not only individuals with enigmatic confidence but also an environment that is tolerant, supportive, and encouraging. A social environment with the mindset of equality can treat the innovative ideas and attempts of ordinary people kindly and tolerate their failures. Instead of ridiculing or mocking people for their humble origins or seemingly crazy ideas, which would strangle innovation in its cradle, this environment fosters innovation. The essence of innovation is a probabilistic issue: the more people try out different new ideas, the higher the chances of success.

**3\. The Mindset of Equality Avoids the Need to Wait for Instructions from Experts and Leaders**

The opposite of equality is a rigid hierarchy. In such an environment, people are accustomed to ranking individuals based on seniority, education, or position. Priority is given to the ideas of top experts and following the directives of leaders. Historically, high-ranking officials, technical bureaucrats, and veteran experts have rarely produced breakthrough innovations. Innovators are more likely to be young people scattered among the general population. Because of their humble backgrounds and lack of influence, their ideas are often ignored, and their attempts are not supported.

**4\. The Origins of the Mindset of Equality in American History**

Looking at human history, a hierarchical system has been the norm, aligning with individual differences and the natural evolution of power. The mindset of equality for all is, in fact, an anomaly.

Reading about the founding history of the United States, we learn that the country's founders included a group of people seeking religious freedom (the Puritans). They aimed to remove the corruption and hierarchical structure of the Roman Catholic Church from the Church of England. They emphasized personal and collective moral purity and the belief that believers could read and understand the Bible independently to establish a direct connection with God. They also advocated for the independent election of their own elders as leaders. This group:

* Began advocating "all men are created equal" in the 1776 Declaration of Independence.
    
* Saw the 1865 13th Amendment to the Constitution: the abolition of slavery,
    
* Witnessed the 1920 19th Amendment to the Constitution: granting women the right to vote nationwide,
    
* Experienced the 1964 Civil Rights Act: prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,
    
* Benefited from the 1965 Voting Rights Act: protecting the voting rights of all citizens, including minorities.
    

Every step in the process of abolishing slavery, expanding voting rights, and implementing other significant social reforms in the United States has been arduous. Each reform has required the active participation of the general populace, including protests, demonstrations, marches, speeches, and legal challenges. Even today, there are still many areas where the United States falls short in promoting and implementing the constitutional spirit of equality for all.

**5\. Promoting Equality for All Can Lead to a More Dignified Life for More People**

Imagine two types of societies: one where everyone strives to be superior in terms of wealth, power, and fame, and another that advocates for diverse values and equality for all. In a society where everyone wants to be superior, most people are likely to end up inferior, as the top positions in wealth, power, and fame are very limited. In contrast, in a society that advocates for diverse values and equality, more people can probably live with dignity, treating each other equally and doing what they consider important (such as sending people to Mars rather than seeking high office), thereby increasing the likelihood of innovation.

**7\. Conclusion**

There are many theories about the roots of innovation. Based on the history and current situation of the United States, I believe that one of the most fundamental driving forces of innovation, which is often overlooked, is the mindset of equality for all and the habit of looking at everyone on an equal basis. The biggest obstacle to innovation is, in fact, hierarchical thinking.

Based on the above understanding, I now try to overcome the hierarchical notions caused by my genetic instincts and culture. I remind myself to look at everyone equally, whether the person is a high-ranking official, a billionaire, a great expert, or a cleaner, or even a homeless person on the street. Interestingly, with this mindset, I find it easier to communicate with people or give speeches. By looking at the audience and more prominent experts equally, I no longer worry about saying something wrong or foolish. I have also started to dislike the popular online notions of "contempt chains." Whenever I see videos or articles discussing contempt chains, I quickly scroll past them. Most people are already victims of hierarchical systems; why would they turn around and become perpetrators by using hierarchical thinking at the first opportunity?

At home, I also instill in my children the idea of looking at everyone equally: not to feel inferior because someone is stronger than you, nor to feel superior because someone is temporarily weaker than you in some aspect. By respecting everyone equally, one can confidently learn from the strong and sincerely help those who are temporarily weaker in some areas. Ultimately, this leads to a harmonious and win-win society.

Regrettably, the current political polarization in the United States is gradually eroding and undermining the constitutional spirit of equality. If the American people do not maintain the founding spirit of equality, and fall back into the historical norm of hierarchical privilege systems, they will lose the most fundamental driving force for innovation.
